def list_function():#These tasks are quite short so only one function was needed.
    names= ['Bob', 'Jill', 'Jack', 'Fred', 'Bill']#The first step is to create a list of names, so that we can then change it and mess with diifferent list functions. 
    print(names)#This just prints the origianal list.
    names[2:2]= ['George', 'Joe']#This methode just adds two different names into the list with out taking any out.
    numbers= [11, 22, 33, 44, 55]#The next step is to create a list of numbers.
    both= (names + numbers)#The variable "both" adds the two lists together.
    print(names)#This prints the three different versions of lists that we made.
    print(numbers)
    print(both)




list_function()#Starts the program.
